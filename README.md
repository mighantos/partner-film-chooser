# Partner film chooser

An app for partners that spend too much time deciding what film to watch.
You can suggest films to watch, vote how incline you are for watching the film,
and creating a list of film to watch together.

*This is mainly a hobby project to try out Kotlin and other technologies
and solve a problem in the process.*
